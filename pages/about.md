Hi! I'm Huiling (Millie) Huang, a Computer Science undergraduate at Nanyang Technological University (NTU).

My work sits at the intersection of computer graphics, interactive systems, and intelligent tooling, where I enjoy building systems that connect human intention with computational processes.

I have experience developing real-time interaction systems (such as gesture-driven virtual sculpting), user-centered interfaces, and lightweight agent frameworks for automating multi-tool workflows. I especially enjoy projects that require both technical depth and design sensitivity, whether that means debugging a geometry pipeline, structuring data flows across tools, or crafting an interface that feels intuitive to users.

I'm currently preparing my graduate studies, where I hope to continue exploring graphics, interaction, and tool-building — areas that allow me to combine engineering problem-solving with creativity and system thinking.

If you're curious about my work, feel free to explore the projects on this site!
